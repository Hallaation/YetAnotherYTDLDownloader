As the name suggests, its yet another YTDLP Downloader GUI.
Built this GUI as both a way to better reinforce my WPF skills and also fulfill a need to better download live streams or videos using YT-DLP.
Encapsulates and automates a lot of the editing I had to do when download directly from a m3u8 source or just downloading live streams in general.
Reducing the amount of bat files for each scenario I have when downloading these files.
